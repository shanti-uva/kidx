This is the management code for the KMaps Index.   Currently it is comprised of three parts:

# a solr self-updating proxy. Updates missing kmapid data when they are queried.
# connectors to various asset managers (e.g. sharedshelf, mediabase, shanti-essays)
# populator:  code which drives population of the index from the various asset managers
